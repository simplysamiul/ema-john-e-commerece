#Project_Details : 
In this project I am try to make using react.js, vanila css and also external packege that is for control specific case. I would to try make a e-commerce project and I am partly suucess about my thinking. In this project have some product card and there are have product price and product details. Also have a price cart there is counting your selected product price and product quantity. I was using localStorage in this project for this reason if you selected such as 4 product then if you reload this page or leave this page but it will be selected. Then if you click review order you can see which was the product you selected. Then if you want you can remove your selected product.After that if you select place order then finally submited all product. So thats it , you can visually see this description inside of the project.
